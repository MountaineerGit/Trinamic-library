## Trinamic TMC2130 driver library 

Written in plain C, processor agnostic. Processor specific low-level communications layer has to be added by user.

This library is used by [grblHAL](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL) and examples of low-level communications layer implementations can be found there.

A [SPI <> I2C](https://github.com/terjeio/Trinamic_TMC2130_I2C_SPI_Bridge) bridge implemented on a TI MSP430G2553 processor that may be used for systems with limited IO capabilities.
